# About Transparent Clock

Transparent Clock was built to give focused users a simple way to keep time visible without opening distracting apps or widgets. The goal is to keep attention on study and deep work while still offering practical tools like a dashboard and a pomodoro timer.

## Who It Is For
- Students
- Focused workers
- Anyone who wants a clean, always‑on‑top time display

## Design Philosophy
- Minimal UI
- Distraction‑free controls
- Offline by default

## Developer Note
I built Transparent Clock to be a calm, reliable companion during study sessions. It stays out of the way, keeps your time visible, and respects your privacy by staying offline.
